Writing in L4 on the LegalSS spreadsheet
****************************************

Your main interface when writing with L4 is on a google sheets spreadsheet called the `LegalSS spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1453008311>`_. This spreadsheet has a special app function that activates the L4 language.

The current version of the `LegalSS spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1453008311>`_ is v0.9.4.3 as of Jan 2023.

Blue box: Sidebar showing activated L4 functions
------------------------------------------------

This is the sidebar with L4 functions that you should see after running :ref:`step 6 <step_6>` and step :ref:`step 7 <step_7>` in the instructions above.

This sidebar can be scrolled down and contains several sections:

Numbered steps that show how you can use L4's output.

    - Step 1 links to an external web app that can be used to explore whether a legal rule is fulfilled or breached, depending on what is written in the red box.

    - Step 2 shows a diagram of the generated legal rule, allowing you to easily refer to whether a legal rule is fulfilled or breached.

    - Step 3 shows a diagram that is clickable and can be expanded to show the logic of why a legal rule is fulfilled or breached.

    - Steps 4 to 24 are options for you to export the L4 diagram and results into different formats. See `Exporting L4` for more information

The area below the numbered steps shows a 'debugging' area where you can check the L4 code that you can use to help fix any error you may be facing when writing L4. We are working on creating information about this 'debugging' area.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Green box: LegalSS spreadsheet tabs linking to other examples
-------------------------------------------------------------

The LegalSS spreadsheet comes with built-in :ref:`examples` that you can navigate to with the tabs at the bottom of the page.

Red box: Environment for writing L4

This is where you write your L4 code.

In this particular tab is the :ref:`Learning L4_exercises`, given in grey cells. The grey box with words contains comments; these comments will not run as L4 code.

The light blue box found in the first column shows you what cell is being selected and that will be edited if you type something. In this example screenshot, a cell highlighted in yellow is selected.

You will fill your answer in the cells highlighted in yellow.
