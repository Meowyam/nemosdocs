Setting up the LegalSS Google Sheet
=========================================

Setting up the LegalSS spreadsheet introduces you to the output sidebar and lets you explore Google Sheets as an Interactive Development Environment (IDE).

Clone the spreadsheet so you can try the exercises yourself.

----------------------------
How to clone the spreadsheet
----------------------------

1. Clone the spreadsheet by clicking on 'File' at the toolbar, then choose the 4th option 'Make A Copy'.

2. A new tab will open on your browser and you will be asked to select a project to open. Choose the first project "LegalSS..." with the version number (e.g. "LegalSSv0.9.4.3"). Do not click on "Untitled Project".

3. When the Apps Script page loads, go back to your copy of the LegalSS Google Sheet in your browser and select the tab "Quickstart", which is the first tab of the LegalSS spreadsheet.

4. Back in the App Script page, click "Run" to execute the function. You will have to grant permission to the App Script to make changes to Google Sheets.

An Execution Log should appear below the App Script. Wait until you read "Execution Completed", highlighted in yellow, before you move on to the next step.

5. Return to the LegalSS Spreadsheet. You should see a sidebar appear on the right side of the page.

If you do not see a sidebar, contact the L4 developers for help.

Manually Updating the Sidebar
-----------------------------

The sidebar has an auto-update function when words are typed in. However, if the auto-update function does not work, you can re-run the app script detailed in step 4 of :ref:`sheets_ide`.
