Introduction
============

This L4 Quickstart guide contains:

    - A brief summary of what L4 is for
    - Setup instructions for out-of-the-box L4
    - A reference of Keywords that are used in L4 under :ref:`keywords`
    - A directory of the use case examples that showcases L4 functionalities

It is intended for 

    - the citizen using the web app trying to get an answer regarding a legal question they have, or 
    - for individuals, like lawyers, who wish to express what they understand of the law in a less ambiguous format.

If you are looking for a comprehensive language syntax reference, explanations of advanced topics like how the Natural Language Generation works in L4, or a collection of FAQs and How-Tos, you should refer to the L4 Manual, available in the `LegalSS Google Sheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1732775477>`_ itself or as a `Read the Docs document <https://legalss-l4-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. 

If you wish to install the whole of L4 for yourself or your organisation, you can refer to the `PDPA DBNO documentation on Read the Docs <https://pdpa-dbno-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

This L4 Quickstart guide was originally written in `a tab in the LegalSS spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1732775477>`_. 

======================
What is L4 Good For?
======================

L4 offers a low-code way for non-lawyers to explore existing contracts and legislation, and to generate new contracts and regulations. 

If the contract you need is already available in the L4 package library, you can just fill in the blanks and generate a document that you can sign, after, of course, running it past your lawyers for review.

The L4 package library will soon contain loan agreements, leasing agreements, and investment agreements like the SAFE. It also contains encodings of insurance policies based on those offered by major insurers, so you can better understand what your medical or travel insurance actually covers.

If you want to customize an existing contract template, you can fork and edit it in the `LegalSS Google Sheets <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1453008311>`_. If you click on the + buttons in the left margin of the spreadsheet, you should see the expanded content.


To make life easier for "legal engineers", L4 generates convenient visualizations of the logic and the moving parts of your "legal program".

L4 also sanity-checks your programs to detect internal conflicts and loopholes.

L4 automatically generates a web app that helps end users explore the logic.

In addition to contracts, L4's package library also contains encodings of legislation and regulation in the areas of data privacy and building permission.

The entire "Quickstart" tab is a tutorial. The other tabs in the LegalSS spreadsheet show examples of L4 at work, and illustrate common real-world usage in both contractual and legislative environments.
