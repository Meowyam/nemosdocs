Introduction
============

This manual is:

    - A conceptual reference explaining why the L4 language is important.
    - A comprehensive language syntax reference for the L4 language.
    - A collection of explanations of advanced topics, such as how the Natural Language Generation works in L4. (Work in progress)
    - A collection of FAQs and How-Tos. (Work in progress)

It is intended for both 

    - The web designer who wants to edit the web tool to make it look better graphically for their own organisation's usage, and
    - The L4 engineer who has some knowledge of the law and wants to edit the web app by editing directly to L4, bypassing the web development team.

For installation instructions for out-of-the-box L4, a quick overview of L4, some examples written in L4, and a brief explanation as to what the L4 language is good for, go to the Quickstart guide. It is available in the `LegalSS Google Sheets <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1453008311>`_ itself, or as a `Read the Docs document <https://legalss-quickstart-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_. 

If you wish to install the whole of L4 for yourself or your organisation, you can refer to the `PDPA DBNO documentation on Read the Docs <https://pdpa-dbno-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

This L4 manual was originally written in `a tab in the LegalSS spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1732775477>`_. 

In the LegalSS spreadsheet, for both the Quickstart guide and the L4 Manual, you should see some "+" icons on the left of the spreadsheet. Clicking those icons will expand and collapse particular sections of the spreadsheet for more or less detail.
