This manual is:

    - A conceptual reference explaining why the L4 language is important.
    - A comprehensive language syntax reference for the L4 language.
    - A collection of explanations of advanced topics, such as how the Natural Language Generation works in L4. (Work in progress)
    - A collection of FAQs and How-Tos. (Work in progress)

For installation instructions, a quick overview of L4, and a brief explanation as to what the L4 language is good for, go to the Quickstart manual. It is available in the `LegalSS Google Sheets <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1453008311>`_ itself, or as a `Read the Docs document <https://legalss-quickstart-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

This manual was originally written in `a tab in the LegalSS spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1leBCZhgDsn-Abg2H_OINGGv-8Gpf9mzuX1RR56v0Sss/edit?pli=1#gid=1732775477>`_. 

In the LegalSS spreadsheet, for both the Quickstart guide and the L4 Manual, you should see some "+" icons on the left of the spreadsheet. Clicking those icons will expand and collapse particular sections of the spreadsheet for more or less detail.
