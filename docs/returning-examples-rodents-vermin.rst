This example focus on a single decision rule drawn from a home insurance policy and its transformations to more easily understood forms.

Decisions express first-order logic, functions, predicates, judgements, and calculation in general.

Concepts introduced:

1. Boolean Structures in detail. 

2. Visualization as an electrical circuit diagram.						

Keywords introduced:

   - DECIDE
   - WHEN
   - UNLESS
   - AND
   - OR
   - NOT

If you happen to know Prolog, you will be familiar with the notion of a Horn clause.

``head(param1, param2, â€¦) :- body1(param3, param4), body2(param5, param6).``

The head, to the left of the :- symbol, is the conclusion of the rule.

The body, to the right of the :- symbol, contains the list of predicates that, when satisfied, conclude that the head of the rule is true.

In L4, the relational predicate on the DECIDE line gives the conclusion of the rule.

The Boolean Structure introduced by the WHEN keyword gives the conditions of the rule.

The keywords WHEN and IF are synonymous in a DECIDE context.

The GIVEN keyword provides other arguments to the decision rule, and is conjoined with the WHEN | IF material.

The expression context of the GIVEN and WHEN | IF includes the history available to the calling context. For example, if the decision is being evaluated for the purposes of executing a certain regulative rule, the trace prior to that state transition is available to the DECIDE rule.

Constitutive rules using WHEN are a subset of Hornlike rules that use DECIDE.

Decision Diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visualization of a decision rule produces a "circuit diagram": it is based on electrical circuit diagrams. If you can find a path from the left side of the diagram to the right, where the relevant terms have the required values,
the overall value of the decision diagram is true.

This is useful because it shows the "big picture" of a legal construct, and suggests ways to short-circuit a particular decision rule.
